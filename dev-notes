TKL-Nomadic-Odoo

  Many Changes to Odoo Build process.  Working to assure .git base is "intact" as it is with OCA Addons.

  Samba Removed
  
  WebConsole (call) made optional  (see Wiki)

        Added Directory Browsing and Docs Link from WebConsole

        Made WebConsole route in HTTPS and HTTP

  Added full pulls for Magento API (OpenLabs) into ISO
        (Why?)  LA 9-9-15  Describe where and how to Use if it is here.

  Added full pulls for OCA / Connector into ISO
        This is critical for Magento/Odoo Connection.  I believe the OpenLabs connection above goes to Magento however.

tkl-nomadic-odoo - 14 (EC2 (EC=Early Candidate)  Implemented wkhtmltox in build.  changed console screens to adminer etc.

tkl-nomadic-ocoo-14.0 (EC1)  (Based on turnkey-lapp) Tested in TKLDev Jessie RC1

 * LAPP Appliance massaged into Odoo Appliance
 * Odoo Proxy set to work on ports 80 (redirected to SSL 443) and Odoo Native 8069

  * Changed Turnkey web control panel to use SERVER_NAME
    #  (original change)  displaying correct host when behind proxy (SERVER_ADDR -> HTTP_HOST).
    mofified now in index.php to work properly in this build to create effective Console (default port 12325)
    (HTTP_HOST -> SERVER_NAME)
  
  * significant changes to conf and host file structures
  
  * git clone restricted to --depth-1  (shrinks build significantly)
    should be able to continue with successive pulls but needs to be tested or perhaps reconfigured.
